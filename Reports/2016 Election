What type of attack was this?
It was definitley phishing attack type of attack  by Russians. The hackers stole thousands of emails from the DNC server and begin to conceal their efforts.


How was the vulnerability discovered?
The FBI contacts the Democratic National Committee’s help desk, cautioning the IT department that at least one computer has been compromised by Russian hackers. A technician scans the system and does not find anything suspicious.The US intelligence community has concluded that there is no doubt the Rsussians were invloved in the 2016 US presidential election. there were leaking stolen e-mails and inflaming tensions on social media. The hackers steal thousands of emails from the DNC server and begin to conceal their efforts.  



How were the attackers able to exploit the vulnerability?
Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta receives a phishing email masked as an alert from Google that another user had tried to access his account. It contains a link to a page where Podesta can change his password. He shares the email with a staffer from the campaign’s help desk. The staffer replies with a typo - instead of typing “This is an illegitimate email,” the staffer types “This is a legitimate email.” Podesta follows the instructions and types a new password, allowing hackers to access his emails.



Were there security measures that could have been taken in order to prevent this attack?
In my opinion they could prevent attack from Russians if they would not open email which he received form Google. These days we all receive emails which look funky for that reason they should of report this email to Cybersecurity team to be checked.
